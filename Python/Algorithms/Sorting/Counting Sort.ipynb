    "## Conditions for Counting Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the reasons why Counting Sort is said to only work for a limited range of non-negative integer values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer values: Counting Sort relies on counting occurrences of distinct values, so they must be integers. With integers, each value fits with an index (for non negative values), and there is a limited number of different values, so that the number of possible different values k is not too big compared to the number of values n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non negative values: Counting Sort is usually implemented by creating an array for counting. When the algorithm goes through the values to be sorted, value x is counted by increasing the counting array value at index x. If we tried sorting negative values, we would get in trouble with sorting value -3, because index -3 would be outside the counting array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited range of values: If the number of possible different values to be sorted k is larger than the number of values to be sorted n, the counting array we need for sorting will be larger than the original array we have that needs sorting, and the algorithm becomes ineffective.\n"
