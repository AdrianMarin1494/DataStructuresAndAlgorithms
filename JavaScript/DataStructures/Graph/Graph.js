// WHAT ARE GRAPHS
// A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph
// Graph: Nodes + Connections

// USES FOR GRAPHS
// Social Networks
// Location / Mapping
// Routing Algorithms
// Visual Hierarchy
// File System Optimizations

// ESSENTIAL GRAPH TERMS
// Vertex - a node
// Edge - connection between nodes
// Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
// Directed/Undirected - directions assigned to distanced between vertices

// TYPES OF GRAPHS
// UNDIRECTED GRAPH
// DIRECTED GRAPH
// WEIGHTED GRAPH
// UNWEIGHTED GRAPH
