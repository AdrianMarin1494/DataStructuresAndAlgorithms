// WHAT IS A HASH TABLE?
// Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs.
// They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.
// Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing values!

// WHY SHOULD I CARE?
// Nearly every programming language has some sort of hash table data structure
// Because of their speed, hash tables are very commonly used!

// Python has Dictionaries
// JS has Objects and Maps*
// Java, Go, & Scala have Maps
// Ruby has...Hashes
// * Objects have some restrictions, but are basically hash tables
