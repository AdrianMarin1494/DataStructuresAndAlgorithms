// DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
// "A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions."

// OVERLAPPING
// SUBPROBLEMS
// A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times

// MEMOIZATION
// Storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again
